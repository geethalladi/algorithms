* README

Creating a python package containing implementation of some of the well known algorithms. Most of
them were created for my own learning purpose. Readability and Correctness are given more weightage
over run time performance. Use them with care.

** Algorithm Design Manual Lecture Practice

This repository is a space for me to play around with the algorithms. Most of theme I learnt by
watching the Algorithm Design Manual Lectures by Steve Skiena. Hopefully, I can implement more
around the following topics

*** Graph Algorithms
**** Shortest Path
**** Spanning Trees
**** DONE Breadth First Search
**** DONE Depth First Search
**** DONE Adjacency List representation
*** Dynamic Programming
*** Backtracking
*** Others
For the list of current TODO items grep for TODO in `adm.org` file.
