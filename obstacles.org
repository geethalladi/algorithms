* Obstacles

  # Obstacles are not negative. Understand that obstacles shows
  # (becomes) the way.

  #  "The mind adapts and converts to its own purposes the obstacle to
  #  our acting. The impediment to action advances action. What stands
  #  in the way becomes the way" - Marcus Aurelius

The following are the hurdles / obstacles faced while implementing algorithms in python

** Precondition checks
- Check pre-conditions in python functions

** Assertion
- Adding assertions in python code
- Turning off assertions in Production

** Modules and their imports
*** Sibling Package
- As of now, using the full package path
- Find ways to use relative package paths

** DONE Upgrading Python inside virtual environment
- Deleted the existing venv
- Reinstalled all the packages
- Folder renaming does not work
- Created it fresh again
** DONE Resolving Collection is unsubscriptable
- Got a lint error
- Required Upgrading python
- Ended up re-creating everything (venv + packages + requirements.txt) from scratch
** DONE Emacs flycheck does not work at times
- Flycheck does not show lint errors
- Activate pyvenv at start
- Switch to test file and it works
# - Activated pyvenv as part of emacs init (later, if required)
** DONE Linting
- Updating lint configuration for variable names
- Allowing simple variable names

** DONE Visualizing graphs in python
- Representing graphs in a Domain Specific Language
- Ability to visualize this representation

** DONE Notes for future usage
- Taking notes for future usage

** DONE Static types
- Add support for static type checking with python 3

** DONE Emacs Integration
*** inferior mode
- Integration with ipython
- eval a file
- reloading file
*** workflow
- Deciding how to do REPL driven development with emacs and python
*** unit testing
- What package
- How to run a standalone file
- How to switch to the corresponding test file
- Create a snippet for test files

** DONE Disabling Lint errors
- Flyspell check for linting errors
- How to disable them when required

** DONE Virtual Environment
- Setting up a separate environment for this project
- Integrating with emacs / elpy

** DONE Package dependencies
- How to capture package dependencies with requirements.txt
- Adding newer packages on demand

** DONE Logging
- Ability to add logs
- Multiple log levels

** DONE Makefile
- Learning Makefile and using it as a runner
- Setting default target

** DONE Unit testing public functions in python
- Decide the unit test library
- Ability to unit test the public functions
- Do a Test Driven Development
- Unit tests before writing the implementation

** DONE Directory Structure
- Decide how the source files and test files are going to be structured
